## Skills

During the last **>15 years**, I encountered a range of different **engineering and team problems**;
leading to a lot of *research*, *experiment*, *test*, *delivery* from the lowest levels of network and systems
to orchestration of **high scale infrastructure**, performant and understandable **CI/CD** tooling, **automation**, **data modeling**...

I think that with seniority, the point is to clearly identify the problem, the time frame and the
complexity; expressively not focusing on the tools at first.

However the market is so focused on the tools x year of usage, that below is an overview of technologies seen during that time.
It is not exhaustive and the table representation really bad for now :)
